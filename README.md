django-firebird
===============

Firebird SQL backend for django

This version of django-firebird is working with fbd [1] in replacemente of kinterbasdb. Therefore it just works with firebird 2.x and later.
Also, the current master version of this repository is being developed under, in current development, django 1.5. This is why it's actually in alpha stage.

Why the change?
fbd will be the next official python-firebird driver, also it has support for python 3.

If you want to know more about the diferrences between fdb and kinterbasdb you can look at:

If you still use kinterbasdb, the original google code repository has an updated django-firebird 1.4 version.
